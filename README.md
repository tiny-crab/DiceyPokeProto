### Dec 15 2021: Re-init prototype and add basic spawning and team rotation code
Pressing the N key will spawn a mon, up to three from your team.
Pressing the E or R keys will rotate the mons through the formation.

### Dec 16 2021: Add formation changes when new mon is spawned
I am not sure if I want this to actually be a game mechanic, but it's something! Next to work on connections between nodes.
